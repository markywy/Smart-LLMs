This is a critical issue that must be addressed, as the output must be a single JSON object without any syntax errors. Additionally, while the flight options provided are realistic in terms of airline and travel details, the prices should be adjusted to reflect more plausible values based on typical domestic flight costs in China. The prices in the previous output were somewhat high for a domestic flight, and the additional information regarding baggage allowance and fees should be more varied to reflect different policies that airlines may have. Furthermore, the output should ensure that the structure is consistent with the expected format, including proper nesting and adherence to JSON standards. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the simulated output to ensure it is a valid JSON object and to improve the realism and accuracy of the flight details.\n",

The output must be a single JSON object with the correct fields matching the tool's [Returns] specification. The previous outputs were structured correctly in terms of content but failed to be presented as valid JSON due to formatting issues. It is crucial to ensure that the output is properly formatted with correct syntax, including the use of quotation marks, commas, and brackets. Additionally, while the content is realistic, the output must ensure that it adheres to the JSON format strictly. Therefore, I will revise the output to ensure it is properly formatted as a valid JSON object.\n",
